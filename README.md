# Button Break

A game that tests the buttons on a Wii U GamePad. 

Button Break is a very simple game made in order to test basic functionality of the Wii U GamePad controller. This was a project that's been held back from release for over a year because of its simplicity, but is finally being released because of the ever-growing homebrew scene.

## Installation
A Wii U homebrew file will be bundled with each release. It should be placed on your SD card, particularly in `wiiu/apps/`.
* It's important to have the Aroma environment installed for Button Break to work. Please visit our [hacking guide](https://wiiu.hacks.guide/) and the [Aroma webpage](https://aroma.foryour.cafe/) if you would like to softmod your Wii U console.

## Usage
If the program is placed correctly on an SD card, Button Break will appear on the Wii U Menu alongside any other homebrew applications. It can then be launched just as anything else.
* If Button Break doesn't show up on the Wii U Menu, confirm you placed the WUHB file on your SD card correctly and restart your console.
